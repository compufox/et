* Extratootrestrial

** Building
*** Prepare

 - make sure you have Qt5 installed (including QWebEngine)
 - install eql5


*** Build (using ASDF with dependencies)

    remove "tmp/" (if present)

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ eql5 make
$ qmake
$ make           (MSVC: nmake)
#+END_SRC

    Now you should find a "et" executable, containing everything in one exe.

    Please note files:

    - =et.asd=            ; define system
    - =package.lisp=      ; system package
    - =dependencies.lisp= ; for Quicklisp (used in "run" and "make")
    - =run.lisp=          ; load system (compiled)

** Notes

*** Windows

    Please note function

    =eql.ignoreIOStreams();=

    in main.cpp, as printing to =*standard-output*= would crash your GUI
    application.


** Deploy

   You may want to strip your exe before deploying:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ strip et
#+END_SRC
